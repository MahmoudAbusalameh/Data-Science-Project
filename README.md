# Murder Crimes Reports 
## The aim:
To find patterns in murders happened between 1980 and 2014 in the United States and to find possible serial killers.
Also to find patterns based on the weapon used city, age, sex and ethnicity of the victim and the perpetrators.

## The data set 
The data set is obtained from the Murder Accountability Project which is the most complete database of homicides in the United States currently available. This dataset includes murders from the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Report from 1976 to the present and Freedom of Information Act data on more than 22,000 homicides that were not reported to the Justice Department. This dataset includes the age, race, sex, ethnicity of victims and perpetrators, in addition to the relationship between the victim and perpetrator and weapon used.
## Tools used:
We will use python graphs and packages we learned in this course.
